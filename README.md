# Why am I even here?

You might ask. I don't know, ask yourself. All of these are most likely junk and no-one (including me) will not use them. Feel free to do whatever with it. I guess.

* The purpose of this repo was that sometimes I forget the implementations of certain algorithms, so I have to take a look in order to remember them. Well, it turns out you don't actually forget that much. It's just so rare that you don't really need a repo, Google exists.
* I don't even know why am I writing this, as if someone would care to read it.
