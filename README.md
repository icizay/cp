# Why am I even here?

You might ask. I don't know, ask yourself. All of these are will never be used probably. Feel free to do whatever. I guess.

* I should add that the resources given here aren't really the best out there. I mostly created these to take a glance of them and remember them. But as it turns out, you don't really use them, and if you do, you somehow remember them without looking here and in conclusion you don't really need them. My coding habits are also changed relatively. Therefore newer code is the better code here, at least that's what I think.
* I don't even know why am I writing this, as if someone would care to read it.
